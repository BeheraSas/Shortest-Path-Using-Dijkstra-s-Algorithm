# Shortest-Path-Using-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. It is widely used in network routing, GPS navigation, and various optimization problems to ensure efficient and optimal pathfinding.

**Lising few real-time applications of Dijkstra's algorithm:**

**1. GPS Navigation Systems**

Application: GPS navigation systems use Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path between a source and a destination.

**2. Network Routing**  

Application: Network routing protocols such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) use Dijkstra’s algorithm to determine the shortest path for data packets between routers.

**3. Financial Services**

Application: Financial institutions use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in financial networks for optimizing investment portfolios, minimizing risk, and maximizing returns.

**Implementation:**

The Python code implements Dijkstra's algorithm using the NetworkX library to find the shortest paths in a graph represented by an adjacency matrix. It begins by importing necessary libraries and reading an adjacency matrix. The matrix defines the connections and weights between nodes. Using NetworkX, the graph is created from this matrix, and Dijkstra's algorithm is applied to compute the shortest paths from a specified source node to all other nodes. The results are then visualized by highlighting the shortest path on the graph, demonstrating the algorithm's application in route planning and network optimization tasks.
